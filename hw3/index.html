		<h3><b>Overview</b></h3>

		<h3><b>Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection </b></h3>
		<p style="color: #DBDEE1; width: 100%">In concept, the ray generation scheme works by generating a ray (or pretty much a vector) from the camera position in world space to a specific point in camera space determined by $(x,y)$. We implement this in generate_ray() by creating a new ray with ray.min_t = nClip, ray.max_t = fClip, and ray.o = camera pos. We are then able to calculate the camera size, and thus calculate the camera relative positions of $x$ and $y$. We can then convert this point to world space, set it to the $d$ value of the ray, and return the ray.</p>
		<p style="color: #DBDEE1; width: 100%">For the randomized ray sampling within a pixel inside of raytrace_pixel(), we use  the get_sample() function to find a random position within the pixel, use generate_ray to create the ray, and then call est_radiance_globabl_illumination() on that pixel. We can then update the pixel and add it to the buffer.</p>
		<p style="color: #DBDEE1; width: 100%">For our triangle intersection, we just used a simple algorithm from the lecture slides. We first calculate $E_1$, $E_2$, $S$, $S_1$, and $S_2$  from the given ray, and then use the equation  $$\frac{1}{S_1 \bullet E_1} \cdot \left(S_2\bullet E_2, S_1\bullet S, S_2\bullet r_d\right)$$ to calculate the intersection. Then, after applying a few checks (namely, checking if the x,y, and z components are in bounds,) we are able to return true. (For intersect(), not has_intersection(), we also add the relevant values to the given intersection.)</p>
		<p style="color: #DBDEE1; width: 100%">For sphere intersection, we used the idea that a ray is determined by $r(t)=o+t\cdot d$. So, from the slides, the intersection of the ray can be found by solving at^2+bt+c-0 where $a$ is the dot product of the ray direction with itself, $b$ is twice the dot product of the ray direction with the vector from the ray origin to the sphere, and $c$ is the squared distance between the ray origin and the sphere center minus the squared radius of the sphere.</p>
		<p style="color: #DBDEE1; width: 100%">Then, we are able to determine if the ray had an intersection with the sphere based on the value of the determinant. Our code implements this quite literally. Additionally, on intersect(), not has_intersection(), we add the intersection time $t$ to the Intersection struct passed into the function.</p>

		<h3><b>Part 3: Direct Illumination</b></h3>
		<p style="color: #DBDEE1; width: 100%">To implement the hemisphere variation for direct lighting, we simply calculated num_samples rays and then returned the average of them. To actually calculate these rays though, first we had to convert wi to world space, after which we could create a ray from hit_p to the world version of wi. Now, we had to call the intersect function on this ray. On the case of an intersection, we then added $$\text{emission}_{\text{BSDF}}\cdot f(w_{\text{out}}, wi)\cdot wi_z \cdot p$$ where p is the value we are normalizing to in the hemisphere. Also, at this point, $f$ simply returns $\frac{\text{reflectance}}{\pi}$ because we only have one type of BSDF. Unfortunately, on this part, we had a very strange bug that we were stuck on for hours. Even more unfortunate for us, it turned out to not be in this part at all, but was actually a small bug with the implementation of Part 2. </p>
		<p style="color: #DBDEE1; width: 100%">Importance sampling was a bit more difficult to implement, as we had to sample from each of the lights instead of in a hemisphere. So, we created a for loop that iterates through each light in scene->lights. Inside of this,  we first check if the light is a delta light (in this assignment it is not), and if it isnâ€™t, we just set our iterations to the variable ns_area_light.</p>
		<p style="color: #DBDEE1; width: 100%">Inside the inner loop (goes for ns_area_light iterations,) we must call sample_L() with the appropriate parameters, and then create a ray with hit_p and wi (We make sure that its min_t and max_t are exactly EPS_F off the borders.) Finally, if there is no intersection, then we use the formula $$f(w_{\text{out}}, wi)\cdot l \cdot  \frac{\text{wi} \bullet n}{\text{PDF}}$$ where $l$ is the return value of sample_L(), and PDF is the pdf attribute of sample_L() to calculate the value at that point, which we then add to our total light sum. We then return that value divided by the total number of iterations.</p>
		<p style="color: #DBDEE1; width: 100%">We can now see some results of the two algorithms. (Hemisphere; top, importance; bottom.)</p>

		<p style="color: #DBDEE1; width: 100%">The differences between these two are, honestly, quite obvious. We also tested light sampling, and the results were pretty interesting. 1, 4, and 16 samples were pretty similar, although 16 was starting to get a fair bit less noisy, only having unacceptable levels of noise in the shadows.</p>

		<p style="color: #DBDEE1; width: 100%">64 samples, on the other hand, resolved most of the issues, but the slightest amount of noise can be seen in the shadow around the bunny still. Also, one interesting thing we noticed with the light sampling is that even on higher samples, the edges never get perfectly crisp as can be seen below, which seems to be a disadvantage of the technique.</p>
