		<h3><b>Single Color Triangles</b></h3>
		<p style="color: #212427; width: 100%">    To rasterize a triangle, we check a grid pixel by pixel to test whether each point lies within the three triangle vertices. We do this mathematically by creating a normal vector pointing inwards from each of our edges, and testing whether the dot product of a vector between our point and the vertex and the normal vector is greater than zero. Instead of sampling the entire screen space, we limited the number of tests we do per triangle to just the ones inside the bounding box of the triangle. To do this, we simply sampled each pixel between the leftmost and rightmost x-coordinate in our triangle’s vertices, and likewise for the highest and lowest y-coordinate. In this process, we faced two challenges. Firstly, for our algorithm to work, we needed to ensure that the normal vectors actually pointed into the triangle. In order to make this work, we tested the winding order of the vertices using <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1165943" style="display: inline"> this</a> formula. After adjusting our vertices so that they are in counter-clockwise order, we had to sample our pixels. Here lies our second, and final, bug that our code had: bounding boxes. Initially, we made it so that the bounding box would round our minimum and maximum values of x and y, which caused many triangles to not render fully, as shown below:</p>

		<p style="color: #212427; width: 100%">    By addressing these issues, we got basic rasterizing to work! Below is an image of a successful render highlighting a major drawback with this algorithm, aliasing, in basic/test4.svg:</p>

		<p style="color: #212427; width: 100%">    For the extra credit, we found a few ways to optimize the rendering script, mostly through precalculation of equations. Our original rendering method was already decently efficient, but it had one large drawback: we were doing a lot of calculation within the for loops. So, we decided to move the calculations of all the vectors out of the nested loops. The vectors that were the most complex to precalculate were p-p0, p-p1, and p-p2, since these had to change each loop. But, these can be set by simply doing a few additions each loop, as opposed to using expensive multiplication. As can be seen by the image below, the new code was about 12% faster.</p>

		<h3><b>Antialiasing by Supersampling</b></h3>
		<p style="color: #212427; width: 100%">    In order to reduce aliasing such as jaggies and floating pixels, we use supersampling. We set a sample rate and sample multiple evenly spaced points inside each pixel, then average them to get the total color of that pixel. This means that if a triangle has some area inside a pixel but doesn’t go through the center, we can still ensure that the figure gets equal representation. For example, if the triangle goes through the top right corner, that would be approximately 1/9 of the pixel’s area, so we would give that pixel 1/9th of the triangle’s color. Initially, we thought it would be more space efficient to keep our screen space array the same dimensions, and simply average down each pixel as we rasterize each triangle. This sounded like a great idea, but when multiple triangles were slightly in a single pixel, this prevented the final pixel color from incorporating all of the triangles involved. Instead, we got weird bright lines cutting through our images. In the end, we decided to multiply the dimensions of our screen space matrix by the sample rate, then rasterize each triangle in our svg by pretending the screen was simply much larger. To draw the matrix onto the screen, we then averaged down for each pixel. Below is an example of supersampling, using 1, 4, and 16 points inside each pixel, reducing aliasing in the same image represented above: </p>

		<h3><b>Transforms</b></h3>
		<p style="color: #212427; width: 100%">    Transforms were honestly pretty easy. All we had to do was change the translation/rotation/scale functions to return a matrix that when multiplied by our current vector in homogeneous coordinates would result in a transformed vector. By modifying the cubeman svg, we were able to make him elastic by stretching his limbs out. I honestly think he's very good at yoga :)</p>

		<p style="color: #212427; width: 100%">    For the extra credit, we implemented the ability to translate the image outside of scrolling. By using the left and right brackets to move left and right and semicolon for up and apostrophe for down, you can now move the image a set amount.</p>

		<h3><b>Barycentric Coordinates</b></h3>
		<p style="color: #212427; width: 100%">    Barycentric coordinates are a neat way to represent the location of a point relative to the vertices of a triangle. Using this method, we were able to represent our point by fractions, each fraction describing how close our point was to a vertex compared to the opposing edge. This allowed us to use three different colors on each of the vertices, and divide them up so we could get a cool gradient. The hardest part about this assignment was the amount of arithmetic involved. Finding the values wasn't too bad, but brainstorming to making the algorithm efficient took up a lot of energy. Nobody really wants to do a thousand multiplies and adds for 20 pixels. Below is a visual description of barycentric coordinates I stole from <a href="https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/q/246858" style="display: inline">Mathematics Stack Exchange</a>:</p>

		<h3><b>Pixel Sampling for Textures</b></h3>
		<p style="color: #212427; width: 100%">    If you want to save an object's coloring as an image instead of making each detail a triangle, texture mapping is the thing for you. In order to implement pixel sampling for textures, we needed to figure out the relative coordinate in our triangle using barycentric coordinates then map these coordinates to coordinates in our texture image. This part wasn't too bad despite the fact that we had to figure out quite a bit of the rasterization workflow. One major bug that we spent too much time on was making sure the vertices were in counter clockwise winding order. Since we copied most of the code from our previous algorithms, we forgot to also account for the texture uv coordinates while testing winding order. Once that was figured out, the hardest part about pixel sampling was edge cases and rounding. Some pixels on the edges of triangles seemed to not work nicely in bilinear sampling since the four nearest pixels were not necessarily the best idea. This resulted in weird lines through triangles, that we solved through edge case tests. The difference between nearest and bilinear sampling is simply that nearest samples the nearest pixel in the texture image and bilinear samples the nearest four pixels then weighted averages them by relative distance. The relative differences are not too noticable when the texture triangle and the screen triangle are similar in dimension, minus a little bit of blur from bilinear. When the dimensions vary a lot, bilinear is clearly superior since this method allows us to reduce aliasing when nearest sampling would otherwise ignore certain pixels simply becase one is closest. Below is an example of linear versus bilinear sampling for texture mapping: </p>
